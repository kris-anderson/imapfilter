				   IMAPFilter

My Notes:
This was forked and includes the needed updates for Ubuntu 14.04 with Lua 5.2.
Lua 5.2 was installed from the Ubuntu repositories (not from source). There
are some required dependencies that must be installed (apt-get install make),
but once those have been met, you should be able to follow the instructions
below to complete your installation.

Also note that I added an imapfilter.conf file. You can copy this to:
/etc/init/imapfilter.conf. This way, the application will run every time the
server boots.

Description

  IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers
  using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends searching queries to
  the server and processes mailboxes based on the results. It can be used to
  delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the same or
  different mail servers. The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are
  supported.

  IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and extension
  language.
